            My hobby is Running for Brews in St. Petersburg, FL. It's a great way to exercise and meet 
            new people with the added benefit of beer. I started attending Running for Brews in 2017 
            and have learned to love running.

          Some people don't like running and they think I'm crazy for running in this heat. It's okay because
          you don't have to run. You can walk, or just sit at the bar and drink. Why not?

          It's okay if you don't like beer. There are non-alcoholic options available.
